This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purposes of this project:
  - To Modernize [The Chaos Foundry](www.chaosfoundry.co/) and decouple it from WP as the site is now hosted on a web Server.
  - Enable Livechat using either [Stream](getstream.io/chat/), or [100ms](https://www.100ms.live) or other frameworks for live broadcast from our Infomaniak provider using [this service] (https://www.infomaniak.com/en/multimedia/streaming/video)
  - Streamline WP design and allow for more reactive design language than SeedProd
  - Gain Technical knowledge for future projects
  - Battle harden the overall design to be less prone to WP-based attacks. 
  - Learn how to use GraphQL
